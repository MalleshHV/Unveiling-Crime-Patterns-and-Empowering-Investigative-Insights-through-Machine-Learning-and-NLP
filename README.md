# Unveiling Crime Patterns and Empowering Investigative Insights through Machine Learning and NLP

## Project Overview
This project aims to leverage machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to unveil crime patterns and provide actionable insights for investigative purposes. By analyzing crime-related data and articles, we seek to uncover hidden trends and enhance the capabilities of law enforcement agencies.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Utilize ML, DL, and NLP to analyze vast amounts of crime-related data.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and visualize emerging crime patterns and trends over time using predictive modeling and deep learning techniques.
- **Predictive Insights**: Offer predictive capabilities that assist law enforcement in proactive measures, utilizing advanced models such as CNN-LSTM and XGBoost.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Choropleth maps are generated to visualize state-wise crime data in India.
