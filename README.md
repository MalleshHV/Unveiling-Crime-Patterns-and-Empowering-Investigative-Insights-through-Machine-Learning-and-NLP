# Unveiling Crime Patterns and Empowering Investigative Insights through Machine Learning and NLP

## Project Overview
This project aims to leverage machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to unveil crime patterns and provide actionable insights for investigative purposes. By analyzing crime-related data and articles, we seek to uncover hidden trends and enhance the capabilities of law enforcement agencies.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Utilize ML and NLP to analyze vast amounts of crime-related data.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and visualize emerging crime patterns and trends over time.
- **Predictive Insights**: Offer predictive capabilities that assist law enforcement in proactive measures.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- **Natural Language Processing Libraries**: 
  - [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
  - [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)
- **Data Visualization Libraries**: 
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
  - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
